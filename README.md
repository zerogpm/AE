# 🚀 Spacey McFacey After Effects Project 🌌

Hello Earthlings! 👽 Welcome to the intergalactic hub of my After Effects project, codenamed: **Spacey McFacey**! Yes, you heard it right, we're shooting past the moon and stars with this one. If you thought gravity was keeping your feet grounded, buckle up! 🚀

## 🌠 What's it all about?

In Spacey McFacey, I've mixed the mystical powers of Adobe After Effects with a dash of cosmic creativity to create animations that are out of this world! From galactic explosions to alien dance-offs, this project has it all. 

## 🌌 Features:

1. **Galactic Graphics**: Higher definition than the Hubble Telescope!
2. **Stellar Animations**: Newton's Laws? Never heard of them!
3. **Alien Encounters**: ET phoned, he wants his moves back! 👽
4. **Intergalactic Jams**: Beats that get even black holes groovin’!

## 🌕 How to Join the Space Crew?

Want to get on board the USS Spacey McFacey? Here’s how you can join the mission:

1. Get yourself Adobe After Effects – this is your spaceship control deck!
2. Clone this repository by running `git clone git@github.com:zerogpm/AE.git` (Change the URL to your repo, duh!).
3. Open `SpaceyMcFacey.aep` in After Effects.
4. Buckle up, and press the space bar. Your journey through the cosmos has begun!

## 🚀 Contribute to the Mission
